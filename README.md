## Project Emilie

An old personal toolkit for UWP and .NET projects, full of many random classes. Some are good, some are not so good, and some that one should never set eyes upon for fear of having your soul crumble to dust. I would not advise much interest in it.

The Composition and Animation extentions are fairly helpful, for all it's worth.

Some of code has been compiled from various sources and may be missing some attributions, but I've attempted to keep it in most places.

The toolkit has been used, in various forms, in applications like:
- Great British Chefs for Windows 8
- Showtime for Xbox One
- HBO Now for Xbox One
- CBS for Xbox One
- WTA for Windows 8
- CBS News for Windows Phone
- Font Candy for Windows Phone & 8.1
- Sky Academy Studios for Windows 10
